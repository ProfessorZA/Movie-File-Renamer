# Movie-File-Renamer
A simple app to bulk-rename movie file names. The purpose of this app is to quickly bulk-rename movie file names that have strange codes, numbers or random text. You ever receive a HDD from a friend containing movies that are all named strangely, containing resolution info, codec info etc.? With this app the names can be cleaned up quickly.

The is still a WIP.
